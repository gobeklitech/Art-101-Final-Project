    <h1>Santa Cruz Kangaroo Rat</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>The Santa Cruz kangaroo rat is a small rodent that is found only in the Santa Cruz Sandhills. More closely related to gophers than true rats, the Santa Cruz kangaroo rat earned its name because it hops on its two large, hind legs. At night, this rare animal emerges from burrows in the sand chaparral community to gather seeds in its cheek pouches, which it then stores in seed caches.Recent research found that three of four Santa Cruz kangaroo rat populations known to occur in 1984 have become extirpated (locally extinct).</p>

    <h3>Interesting Fact:</h3>

    <p>The kangaroo rat’s unique metabolism and specialized kidneys allow it to survive without consuming fresh water or eating leaves with moisture. It also has something like a natural humidifier in its underground den as a result of the moisture from its breath that keeps its den moist which then allows moisture to be reabsorbed by the rat with the help of its specialized organ in its nasal passage.
