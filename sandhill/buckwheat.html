    <h1>Ben Lomond Buckwheat</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>Ben Lomond buckwheat blooms between June and September, producing thick heads of tiny white flowers. It can be found within canopy gaps in sand chaparral, as well as a variety of microhabitats within sand parkland.Like many other Sandhills plants, the Ben Lomond buckwheat has white hairs on its leaves that reflect excess sunlight and reduce water loss, which makes it capable of adapting to life in the hot, arid Sandhills. The ongoing loss and degradation of Sandhills habitat has led to the California Native Plant Society listing this Sandhills native one of California's most rare and endangered plants.</p>

    <h3>Interesting Fact:</h3>

    <p> Ben Lomond buckwheat is a perennial herb so it has the potential to have a lifespan of at least more than two years.</p>
