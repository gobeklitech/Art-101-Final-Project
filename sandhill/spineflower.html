    <h1>Ben Lomond Spineflower</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>Named for the spiny bracts surrounding its flowers, this native plant inhabits various areas within sand chaparral.The Ben Lomond spineflower can be very abundant in the local region, turning the soil surface pink when it flowers in April and May. This plant is naturally rare, due to its small geographic range (Santa Cruz County) and narrow habitat specificity (Zayante soils). The existence of the Ben Lomond spineflower is threatened by habitat loss as well as habitat degradation due to fire exclusion, exotic plants, and recreation. Therefore, this  plant is considered endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
    
    <h3>Interesting Fact: </h3>

    <p>The spineflower only grows in Santa Cruz  Sandhills (only California) primarily because it can not handle shade of any kind and needs to be consistently in direct sunlight.</p>
