    <hr>

    <p>Silverleaf (or Bonny Doon) manzanita is a large shrub that is named for the region where it is especially abundant and the silver-like color of its leaves, which reflect excess sunlight and reduces water loss.This plant blooms in  November and January, producing dense clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers.Silverleaf manzanita is the dominant plant of sand chaparral. However, habitat loss and degradation still threaten the survival of this plant, which is recognized by the California Native Plant Society as an endangered plant species in California.</p>
    
    <h3>Interesting Fact:</h3>

    <p> The Silverleaf Manzanitas fruits resemble small red apples which is why it is called “manzanita,” because it means “little apple” in Spanish.</p>
