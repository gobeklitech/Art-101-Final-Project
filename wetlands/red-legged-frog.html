    <h1>Red Legged Frog</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>The Red Legged Frog is a federally threatened species which is the result of a few different factors which include : A large culinary demand for frog’s legs in the mid 1800s which led to them being harvested, widespread draining of ponds and wetlands for development and agriculture over the past 150 years, and the introduction of non-native plants and animals such as the bullfrog and fish that prey on the frogs. In adults, the bellies and undersides of the hind legs are red or salmon pink; backs are brownish and flecked with spots. Young frogs have more pronounced dorsal spotting, and may have yellow, not red, on the underside of the legs.</p>

    <h5>Interesting Fact:</h5><p> These are the largest native frogs in the American West, the red-legged frog can be five inches long.</p>
